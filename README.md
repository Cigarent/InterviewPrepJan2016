# UPL Interview Prep

Collection of resources brought to you by the [UPL](http://upl.cs.wisc.edu) to help prepare you for interviews!

We **encourage you** to do these problems and submit pull requests for good answers!

Other talks and events from the UPL are [here](https://github.com/UW-UPL/Talks).


## Events

We've done numerous interview prep events with the UPL. You can find those questions and solutions here:

* [Spring 2016](Spring2016/)
* [Fall 2015](Fall2015/)


## Building your own suite of questions

If you wish to build your own suite of questions, you can follow these instructions using a .tex file from one of the question repositories.

Simply putting the .tex file into an http://overleaf.com project and then saving as a PDF works well. Otherwise, install your favorite LaTeX distribution and do the same thing locally. Sometimes, in Unix, the `pdflatex` command is available. You can run `pdflatex questions.tex` to generate the PDF as well.
