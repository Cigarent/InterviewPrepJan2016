## Building your own suite of questions
Simply putting the .tex file into an http://overleaf.com project and then saving as a PDF works well. Otherwise, install your favorite LaTeX distribution and do the same thing locally. Sometimes, in Unix, the `pdflatex` command is available. You can run `pdflatex questions.tex` to generate the PDF as well.
